abstract = {Large phylogenomics data sets require fast tree inference methods, especially for maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenies. Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2{\%} and 87.1{\%} of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7{\%} and 47.1{\%} of the DNA alignments and 42.2{\%} and 100{\%} of the protein alignments, respectively. However, the range of obtaining higher likelihoods with IQ-TREE improves to 73.3-97.1{\%}. IQ-TREE is freely available at http://www.cibiv.at/software/iqtree.},

abstract = {Bayesian phylogenetic inference aims to estimate the evolutionary relationships among different lineages (species, populations, gene families, viral strains, etc.) in a model-based statistical framework that uses the likelihood function for parameter estimates. In recent years, evolutionary models for Bayesian anal-ysis have grown in number and complexity. RevBayes uses a probabilistic-graphical model framework and an interactive scripting language for model specification to accommodate and exploit model diversity and complexity within a single software package. In this unit we describe how to specify standard phylogenetic models and perform Bayesian phylogenetic analyses in RevBayes. The protocols focus on the basic analysis of inferring a phy-logeny from single and multiple loci, describe a hypothesis-testing approach, and point to advanced topics. Thus, this unit is a starting point to illustrate the power and potential of Bayesian inference under complex phylogenetic models in RevBayes. C},

abstract = {Lemons, limes and citron constitute a group of closely related Citrus species, whose species delimitations and taxonomic relationships are unclear. In order to identify karyotypic similarities and species relationships within this group, the CMA+/DAPI- banding pattern and the distribution of the 5S and 45S rDNA sites of 10 accessions of lime, lemon, and citron were investigated. The four cultivars of C. limon analyzed showed the same pattern of CMA+ bands and rDNA sites, suggesting that they originated from a single germplasm, later differentiated by distinct somatic mutations. The lemons C. jambhiri, C. limonia and C. volkameriana displayed karyotypes very similar to each other, but they differed from C. limon by the absence of a single chromosome with one band in each telomere. The limes, C. aurantifolia and C. limettioides, seemed less related to each other and exhibited different heteromorphic chromosome pairs. In C. aurantifolia, the presence of a chromosome type unknown in all other Citrus species cytologically known so far supports the assumption that this accession may be derived from a hybrid with a species from the subgenus Papeda or from another genus. Citrus medica was the only homozygous accession of this group and all of its chromosome types were clearly represented in limes and lemons, some of them forming heteromorphic pairs. The analysis of the distribution of rDNA sites allowed a further refinement of the comparison among accessions. The lemons and limes were heterozygous for all rDNA sites, whereas C. medica was entirely homozygous. These data support the hypothesis that C. medica is a true species while the other nine accessions are hybrids. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

abstract = {Mandarins are among the main citrus species and constitute a morphologically diverse and taxonomically controversial group. Cytogenetic studies were limited to the determination of its karyotype formula and the localization of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sites. The cytogenetic map of Poncirus trifoliata, established by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using single-copy bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) together with the localization of rDNA sequences and heterochromatin (CMA/DAPI banding pattern), represented an important milestone for the cytogenetic studies of the citrus species. In this work, the cytogenetic map of Citrus reticulata cv. Cravo, one of the pure species of the genus, was built using BACs from P. trifoliata, including the citrus tristeza virus resistance locus (Ctv), to detect homeologies and structural karyotypic changes between these species. Except for chromosomes 2 and 3, heterochromatin distribution and position of BACs were maintained in comparison to P. trifoliata, indicating a high synteny between both karyotypes and supporting a close phylogenetic relationship between these species. A break of colinearity was observed between BAC clones and the CMA+ bands (including rDNA loci) from chromosomes 2 and 3, which could be mainly explained by amplification and reduction of the satellite DNA sequences that constitute the heterochromatic bands of these chromosome pairs.},

abstract = {Pummelo (Citrus maxima) is considered as one of the true citrus species. Together with mandarin (C. reticulata), it gave rise to the hybrid sweet orange (C. sinensis) and other important citrus crops. Although these species have 2n = 18, each has a unique heterochromatin distribution. The aims of this study were to identify chromosome homoeologies between pummelo and other true citrus species, to investigate the karyotypic changes involved in the chromosomal evolution between true citrus and to shed light into the origin of sweet orange hybrid karyotype. Mitotic metaphase chromosomes of pummelo and sweet orange were double stained with the fluorochromes CMA/DAPI (Chromomycin A3/4{\&}rsquo;-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), and identified by FISH (Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization) with chromosome-specific BAC (Bacterial Artificial Chromosome) markers. The results were compared to previously established cytogenetic maps of mandarin, C. medica and Poncirus trifoliata. Only chromosomes 1, 4 and 8 were maintained unaltered among species, with chromosomes 2 and 3 being among the least conserved in heterochromatin distribution. BACs were conserved in position among homoeologs and the markers mapped to chromosomes 2 and 3 indicated that sweet orange karyotype largely conserved one chromosome from pummelo and one from mandarin. Despite conserved synteny, expansion and contraction of heterochromatic blocks accounted for the differences between karyotypes, even between the hybrid sweet orange and pummelo.},

The CMA karyotype composition of C. schweinfurthii was very simple (14D + 4E), while that of 'Nanpu' tangor showed more complicated chromosome types (1A + 4C + 5D + 8E). Two progenies with C. schweinfurthii as the maternal parent showed a karyotype of 1A + 1C + 11D + 5E, suggesting that each of the type A and C chromosomes was inherited from 'Nanpu' tangor. GISH-CMA analysis in one of these progenies showed a clear distinction between parental chromosomes, and revealed that the hybrid progeny arose due to fertilization between a female gamete with a CMA karyotype composition of 7D + 2E from C. schweinfurthii and a male 1A + 1C + 4D + 3E gamete from 'Nanpu' tangor. The result suggests that C. schweinfurthii had homomorphic homologous chromosomes as a wild species, while 'Nanpu' tangor had heteromorphic homologous chromosomes. {\textcopyright} 2010 JSHS.},

abstract = {Mandarin is the major type of citrus grown in Jeju, Korea and has a long history of cultivation there. Landrace Citrus species represent broad and natural genetic variability, which are important and valuable as genetic material. In this study, metaphase chromosomes of six Korean landrace mandarins were analyzed to understand the phylogenetic relationship among them and to compare these characteristics with those of other Citrus species at a cytogenetic level using CMA banding patterns and rDNA loci. Chromosomes were categorized into five types according to the distribution and number of heterochromatic CMA-positive bands; type A chromosomes have two telomeric and one proximal bands, type B have one telomeric and one proximal bands, type C have two telomeric bands, type D have one telomeric band, and type E have no band. Gamza mandarin (C. benikoji) displayed the 1A/45S + 2B/45S + 2C + 5D + 1D/45S + 1D/5S-45S + 6E pattern, without a solitary 5S rDNA locus that differentiated the gamza mandarin from other accessions. A solitary 5S rDNA locus was observed in the chromosomes of byungkyul mandarin (C. platymamma) (1A/45S + 2B/45S + 1C + 6D + 1D/45S + 1D/5S-45S + 5E + 1E/5S) and cheongkyul mandarin (C. nippokoreana) (1A/45S + 1B/45S + 1C + 7D + 1D/5S + 1D/45S + 1D/5S-45S + 5E). The chromosome composition of byungkyul mandarin based on CMA banding pattern and rDNA loci suggests that byungkyul mandarin may be related to pummelo, sweet orange, and members of the Citrus subgenus Papeda during its evolution. Cheongkyul mandarin possessed a distinct marker chromosome (D/45S) that can be used to distinguish cheongkyul madrarin from the other Korean landrace mandarins. Jinkyul mandarin (C. sunki) (1A/45S + 1B/45S + 1C + 10D + 2D/5S-45S + 3E) may be related to pummelos. The karyotype of pyunkyul mandarin (C. tangerina) (3B/45S + 2C + 7D + 1D/5S-45S + 5E) suggests that the pyunkyul mandarin is a hybrid between C. grandis and C. reticulata. Binkyul mandarin (C. leiocarpa) (1A/45S + 1C + 6D + 2D/45S + 2D/5S-45S + 6E) seemed to be related to mandarins and pummelos. Heterozygous karyotypes of six accessions separated and differentiated each of the six Korean landrace mandarins and potential marker chromosomes were identified.},
